## Workflow Example: Add Component

```
Agent needs to add a component

Step 1: Orient self (1 min)
├─ Read: This INDEX.md (5 min)
└─ Understand: memory.md organization

Step 2: Get pattern (2 min)
├─ Open: memory.md
├─ Search: "Component Template"
└─ Copy: Template code

Step 3: Understand rules (2 min)
├─ Search: "Key Rules" (in SECTION 2)
└─ Verify: Will follow these

Step 4: Find example (1 min)
├─ Memory says: Components in app/components/[NAME]/
├─ Use grep: find app/components -name "index.vue"
└─ Read: 1 existing component (50 lines)

Step 5: Write code (0 min)
├─ Use template from memory
└─ Follow rules from memory

Step 6: Verify (1 min)
├─ Check: All rules from SECTION 10 followed
└─ Test: npm run test:unit

Total tokens: ~5K (grep + read 1 example)
Without memory: ~80K (explore 30+ files)
Savings: 75K tokens
```

---

## Workflow Example: Fix Bug

```
Agent needs to fix a bug

Step 1: Locate bug (2 min)
├─ memory.md SECTION 11: By Feature Area
├─ Know where bug likely is
└─ Grep for: grep -r "bugKeyword" app/

Step 2: Understand constraints (1 min)
├─ memory.md SECTION 10: Never violate these
└─ Plan fix within constraints

Step 3: Check pattern (1 min)
├─ memory.md relevant section
└─ Know how to implement fix

Step 4: Implement fix (0 min)
├─ Write code following pattern
└─ No need to explore

Step 5: Validate (1 min)
├─ npm test
└─ git diff

Total tokens: ~8K (read sections + grep + read buggy file)
Without memory: ~50K (explore, understand bug context, find solution)
Savings: 42K tokens
```

## Search Strategy

### If you know the keyword:
```
Ctrl+F in memory.md → Find section → Read section
```

### If you know the task:
```
1. Check README.md "Quick Search Guide"
2. Find matching task
3. Go to suggested section
4. Search with suggested keyword
```

### If you don't know where to look:
```
1. Read this INDEX.md (3 min)
2. Pick your role's path
3. Follow suggested sections
4. Use Ctrl+F within those sections
```

---

## Update Flow

When something changes in the code:

```
1. Note what changed
2. Update memory.md relevant section
3. Update "UPDATE HISTORY" in memory.md
4. (Optional) Commit to git with message:
   "docs(memory): update [SECTION] for [change]"
```

## Token Budget Summary

| Task | Read Time | Token Cost | Savings vs. Explore |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| First-time orientation | 45 min | 15K | 85K (85%) |
| Add component | 10 min | 5K | 75K (94%) |
| Fix bug | 5 min | 8K | 42K (84%) |
| Write test | 5 min | 4K | 26K (87%) |
| Add feature | 15 min | 10K | 90K (90%) |

**Average savings per task**: 80% of tokens

## Verification: Are You Using Memory Correctly?

✅ **Good Signs**:
- You started by reading README.md
- You searched memory.md with Ctrl+F
- You copied templates from memory.md
- You used grep patterns from SECTION 12
- Your code follows constraints from SECTION 10
- You haven't opened 10+ files

❌ **Bad Signs**:
- You're opening files one by one
- You're searching for patterns in codebase
- You don't know what the constraint section says
- You've read 30+ files already
- You're exploring instead of referencing memory

If you see bad signs: **Stop and go back to memory.md**

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Bookmark SECTION 12** (grep patterns) in memory.md
2. **Keep README.md open** (for reference)
3. **Use Ctrl+F** (it's your best friend)
4. **Copy templates exactly** (don't modify until you understand)
5. **Check constraints** (before writing any code)
6. **Update memory** (when you find it's wrong)
