# Workflow for Agent: Setting Up Nuxt CI/CD on Hostinger

This document provides instructions for an AI agent to create or modify a GitHub Actions workflow for a Nuxt project (SSG) to be deployed to Hostinger with a manual approval gate.

## Objective

Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file that:

1. Builds the Nuxt application on every `push` and `pull_request`.
2. Deploys to a Hostinger server via `rsync` **only** after a Pull Request is merged into `master` or via a manual trigger.
3. Uses separate jobs for `build` and `deploy` to handle permissions and separation of concerns.
4. **Implements an automatic retry mechanism** to handle transient network failures with the server.

## Git Flow Strategy

This project follows a Git Flow-inspired branching model:

- **`dev` Branch**: The main integration branch. All development branches must be created from `dev`.
- **`feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `refactor/*` Branches**: Temporary branches for specific tasks. They must always target `dev` in Pull Requests.
- **`master` Branch**: The stable production branch. The `dev` branch is merged into `master` only when a new release is ready for production.

**Deployment Rule**: The production deployment is **only** triggered when code is merged into the `master` branch. Merges into `dev` will trigger a build for validation but will not result in a production upload.

## 1. Triggers

The workflow should listen to:

- `push` on the `master` and `dev` branches.
- `pull_request` targeting the `master` and `dev` branches.
- `workflow_dispatch` (manual button).

## 2. GitHub Secrets

The agent must inform the user that the following secrets are required in the repository settings:

- `HOSTINGER_USER`: The Hostinger SSH username (e.g., `u123456789`).
- `HOSTINGER_DOMAIN`: The target domain name (e.g., `exemplo.com`).
- `HOSTINGER_IP`: The IP address of the server (numeric IP is recommended for speed/stability).
- `HUGONORTE_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY`: The private SSH key for authentication.
- `HOSTINGER_PORT` (optional, default 65002): The SSH port.

## 3. Workflow Structure

### Job: Build

- **Environment**: `ubuntu-latest`.
- **Steps**:
  - Checkout code.
  - Setup Node.js (Version 22+).
  - Install dependencies (`npm install`).
  - Generate static site (`npm run generate`).
  - **Upload Artifact**: Use `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to save the `.output/public/` directory with the name `build-output`.

### Job: Deploy

- **Dependencies**: `needs: build`.
- **Environment**: `ubuntu-latest`.
- **Conditional**: `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request' && (github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch')`.
- **Steps**:
  - **Download Artifact**: Use `actions/download-artifact@v4` to retrieve the `build-output` into `.output/public/`.
  - **Deploy with Retry**: Use `nick-fields/retry@v3` around a shell command.
    - **Attempts**: 3
    - **Delay**: 120s (2 minutes)
    - **Command**:
      ```bash
      eval $(ssh-agent -s)
      echo "${{ secrets.HUGONORTE_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY }}" | tr -d '\r' | ssh-add -
      rsync -avzr --delete -e "ssh -p 65002 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" .output/public/ ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_USER }}@${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_IP }}:/home/${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_USER }}/domains/${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_DOMAIN }}/public_html/
      ```

## 4. Critical Implementation Detail

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why use a direct shell command for deployment instead of an Action wrapper?**
> When dealing with multiline secrets like Private SSH Keys, nesting them inside a YAML-based retry wrapper (like `Wandalen/wretry.action`) often causes **YAML parsing errors** (`block mapping entry error`). This happens because the secret expansion breaks the indentation of the wrapper's block string.
>
> **Solution**: Using `nick-fields/retry` with a direct `command` block is the most robust method. It treats the secret as a simple string expansion inside a bash script, avoiding all YAML indentation issues.

## 5. Nuxt Configuration Hints

- Ensure `nuxt.config.ts` does not have a hardcoded `baseURL` if deploying to a subdirectory, or adjust the `remote_path` accordingly.
- The project must be configured as SSG (Static Site Generation), which occurs during `npm run generate`.
